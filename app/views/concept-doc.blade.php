<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>TheDevs.Org was born out of the need of one developer to connect with other developers around him and to and share knowledge and opportunities in tech around him with fellow developers. </span><span><a href="http://thedevs.org/stories/11">http://thedevs.org/stories/11</a></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Thedevs.org catalyzes tech communities in diverse regions of the world. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It does this by connecting developers and tech organisations both globally and locally using a map and a smart search feature </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mapping Developers, Organizations, Events, Projects &amp; Stories in Tech Worldwide</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is a location-based social network for software developers</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Empowering freelance developers globally</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The idea is to enable software developers and aspiring software developers to come together to to co-work and to build stronger local networks from all corners of the world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Where Devs Connect connect physically &amp; locally</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A globally connected network of devs to catalyse innovation and development</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Region-based Tech Communities - both small and large region</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Counties, cities, town, estates, country, continent, world</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>LESS IS MORE</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Discourses</strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>1. Most tech hubs and user-groups all over the world are concentrated in highly modernised and developed locations of the world like Silicon Valley. We are trying to spark and strengthen tech communities away from the cities. In the counties in Kenya and the suburbs off the world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>2. Collaboration plays a huge role in influencing innovation. Good ideas need a team and partners and exposure to critics and feedback in order to germinate successfully. Inability for developers to discover each other and connect physically locally in the developing locations of the world is a big hindrance to this development. We need more information exchange, networking, coworking and peer programming.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>3. Traditionally, software development was typically done by people who are reserved and it was unhealthy. We are trying to make it a communal and fun activity of the 21st century. So &nbsp;we are facilitating the tribe of social developers with a tool to connect and cowork.</span></p>
