		OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h4>
	<p>
		Your privacy is important to us.&nbsp; To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. &nbsp;At TheDevs.Org, we will never sell, rent, trade or license, in whole-part or piecemeal, any information that we hold about or relating to you, however gathered, to any third-party. Access to your information with TheDevs.Org will be restricted and accessible only where necessary to the function for which it was collected.&nbsp; To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
	<h4>
		THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
	<p>
		This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on TheDevs.Org web site.&nbsp; The types of personal information collected by TheDevs.Org’s web pages are:</p>
	<ul><li>
			Name</li>
		<li>
			Email address</li>
	</ul><p>
		You may elect to provide the following information for specific activities on our website:</p>
	<ul><li>
			Address(es)</li>
		<li>
			Phone number</li>
		<li>
			Other Contacts</li>
	</ul><h4>
		HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h4>
	<p>
		We let you decide what information you shall provide about yourself. You can edit any record associated with your account and switch whether its public or not</p>
	<p>
		We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive, and to connect you with someone with whom you elect to communicate.&nbsp; We will occasionally email you to inform you of updates.&nbsp; Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
	<p>
		If you log in via any External Provider like Facebook, Google or Github, your personal profile data can only be used to complete your profile on thedevs.org and not for any other purpose.</p>
	<p>
		We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and to share with potential advertisers.&nbsp; For example, we may tell an advertiser that <em>x </em>number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that <em>y </em>number of people filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
	<p>
		Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above, including generating cross-reference or collate-passed and passive data to generate “user profiles,” without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.&nbsp; We never seek any more information except that which is absolutely necessary for the desired action to be completed.&nbsp; We do not place “cookies” (small text files) on your system for any reason.</p>
	<h4>
		OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h4>
	<p>
		To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online to protect the integrity of your data, at least as carefully as it would for TheDevs.Org’s data, against modification, disclosure or destruction.&nbsp; In the event it is discovered that unauthorized access to data occurred, accidentally or otherwise, TheDevs.Org will attempt to immediately notify you and explain TheDevs.Org’s remedial action.</p>
	<h4>
		OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h4>
	<p>
		Protecting the privacy of the very young is very important.&nbsp; For that reason, TheDevs.Org never collects or maintains information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
	<h4>
		HOW TO ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
	<p>
		You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by reviewing your profile via the links on every page of our website.&nbsp; We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.</p>
	<p>
		You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by changing your profile online, or by sending us a request that credibly shows error.&nbsp; You can, at any time, request that TheDevs.Org permanently erase any and all of your personal and identifiable information directly related to yourself at any time and TheDevs.Org will take action regarding your request as quickly as reasonably possible and notify you when the action is completed.</p>
	<p>
		To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identify before granting access or making corrections.</p>
	<h4>
		CHANGES REGARDING THIS PRIVACY AND ONLINE DATA COLLECTION NOTICE</h4>
	<p>
		TheDevs.Org reserves the right to change or modify the terms of this Privacy and Online Data Collection Notice and shall take reasonable action to notify TheDevs.Org users of any changes.</p>
	<h4>
		HOW TO CONTACT US</h4>
